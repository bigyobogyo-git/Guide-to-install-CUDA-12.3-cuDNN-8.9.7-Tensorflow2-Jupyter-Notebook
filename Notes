As a new nvidia driver came out today incompatibilty error with cuda appeared. Simple fix:

Uninstall tensorflow:
$  pip uninstall pip uninstall tensorflow[and-cuda]

Re-install with pip:
$  pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]

There is no need to exist from the jupyter notebook just open a new terminal and log in to the virtualenv and runt he code again once the installation is finished. 
Either returnign back to the old nvidia driver or pip uninstall and re-install tensorflow with cuda for every new notebook.
