As a new nvidia driver came out today incompatibilty error with cuda appeared. Simple fix:

Uninstall tensorflow:
$  pip uninstall pip uninstall tensorflow[and-cuda]

Re-install with pip:
$  pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]

There is no need to exist from the jupyter notebook just open a new terminal and log in to the virtualenv and runt he code again once the installation is finished. 

Restart will fix the problem permanently though.
