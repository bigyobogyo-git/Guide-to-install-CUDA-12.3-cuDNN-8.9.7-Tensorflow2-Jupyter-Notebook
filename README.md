Keras examples from the official site.

This is just to test the server with tensorflow 2.20.0 to see how my 2080ti performs. It is only for educational purposes and for updating the codes so they can be run on my server. I hope this finds others well so they can start exploring deep learning with the given examples. I have no desire to analyse the codes or to criticize them just to make them run on the newest stable server and sharing it with others. Of course it might be different from hardware to hardware but my GPU seems to hold it well enough to run the codes. 

Again thanks for the community!
