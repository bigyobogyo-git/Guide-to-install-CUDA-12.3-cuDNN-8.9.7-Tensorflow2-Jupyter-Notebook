Keras examples from the official site.

This is just to test the server with tensorflow 2.20.0 to see how my 2080ti performs. It is only for educational purposes and for updating the codes so they can be run on my server. I hope this finds others well so they can start exploring deep learning with the given examples. I have no desire to analyse the codes or to criticize them just to make them run on the newest stable server and sharing it with others. Of course it might be different from hardware to hardware but my GPU seems to hold it well enough to run the codes. 

Notes are in the ADD FILES VIA UPLOAD section of the files. I am not going to name all of them separetaly. :-) Most packages are installed within the virtualenvs in order to keep the OS clean and stable. Some must be installed outside of the virtualenv but all the $  pip install xyz is happening within the virtualenv. Try to experience if you can open a second terminal and log into your virtualenv while running the jupyter lab or notebook to see if you could install the missing dependencies without turning the kernel off. It is a good practice to know this as restarting the server every time in the middle of a project as not the best solution. It is advised to have a fresh kernel start for every project and obviously donwloading the data to a different location if you reach your disk limit like I did. :-) I would suggest to be as practical as you can because it is the aim of the open source softwares. 

Again thanks to the community!
